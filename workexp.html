									<h2>Associate Data Scientist</h2>
									<h4>Constella Intelligence</h4>
									<div class="justify">
									<p>During my tenure, I played a pivotal role in improving data quality and accuracy through various data analysis techniques. Utilizing AWS SageMaker, I applied data normalization, outlier detection, and feature engineering to the dataset, resulting in significant enhancements. By ensuring the data was clean, consistent, and reliable, I contributed to a remarkable 20% increase in the speed of elastic search for a massive 200 GB dataset stored in Amazon S3. This improvement not only boosted search performance but also positively impacted overall system efficiency and user experience.</p>
									<p>One of my notable achievements was building a powerful machine learning model in Python to address the security concerns related to potentially harmful emails. By predicting email ID maliciousness based on their internet presence, the model effectively identified potential threats and enabled proactive security measures. To provide seamless access to this functionality, I deployed the model as an API using Flask. This deployment achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 93% in identifying malicious emails, significantly improving the organization's security posture.
										In addition to my technical contributions, I took on leadership responsibilities within the data science department. During a merger, I assumed the position of department lead and took charge of all ongoing projects. Through my unwavering dedication and proactive approach, I ensured the timely delivery of these projects, instilling confidence in the company and establishing a reputation for reliability.</p>
									<p>Recognizing the need for continuous improvement, I initiated an end-to-end operational plan focused on enhancing performance across various aspects of data handling, project management, and implementation. By streamlining processes and optimizing workflows, this comprehensive plan resulted in an estimated time reduction of 15% for ongoing projects. I also played an integral role in expanding the data science team by actively participating in the hiring process, ensuring the recruitment of skilled professionals aligned with the organization's goals.</p>
									<p>To further demonstrate my expertise, I developed an in-house categorization tool utilizing Large Language Models in PyTorch from Hugging Face. This tool proved to be instrumental in categorizing and organizing web data efficiently, eliminating the need for a third-party subscription and resulting in substantial cost savings of $15K annually.
										As part of my continuous pursuit of innovative solutions, I leveraged cutting-edge technologies such as TensorFlow to develop an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. This model accurately extracted personally identifiable information (PII) from unstructured data sources, significantly improving the organization's ability to safeguard sensitive data. With a 35% improvement in accuracy, the NLP model empowered the organization to handle and protect PII more effectively, enhancing data privacy and compliance.										
										Furthermore, I implemented a real-time client notification system that reduced response time to security changes by 50%. By promptly notifying clients of potential threats and vulnerabilities, we were able to proactively mitigate cyber-attacks and ensure a robust security framework.</p>
									<p>Throughout my role, I consistently demonstrated my ability to solve complex problems, leverage emerging technologies, and collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. My contributions as a data scientist, leader, and innovator resulted in significant improvements in data analysis, security, cost optimization, and operational efficiency, making valuable contributions to the organization's success.</p>

									<h2>Data Science Intern</h2>
									<h4>AVISO AI</h4>
									<div class="justify">
									<p>During my time at Aviso AI, I had the opportunity to analyze Salesforce data and implement valuable enhancements that had a significant impact on the sales cycle. By applying advanced data analysis techniques, I was able to improve the accuracy of our predictions for each stage of the sales cycle, leading to a remarkable 20% increase in overall accuracy. This improvement had a direct correlation with the success of our sales efforts, resulting in a noteworthy 12% growth in sales.</p>
									<p>I utilized Salesforce Einstein Analytics to implement advanced clustering algorithms and optimize resource allocation strategies within the sales domain. By leveraging K-means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN algorithms, I successfully identified distinct patterns and segments within the sales data, allowing for targeted sales strategies and improved performance. Through collaborative efforts with the sales teams, we interpreted the data, identified areas of improvement, and developed actionable strategies to drive sales growth. Additionally, by strategically allocating resources based on data-driven insights, we streamlined operations and achieved a significant reduction of $8K in sales costs, ultimately contributing to the organization's profitability and success.</p>
									<p>These achievements highlight my ability to leverage data analysis techniques to drive positive outcomes in sales performance. By utilizing Salesforce data and implementing enhancements, I was able to enhance accuracy, improve sales growth, and optimize resource allocation, leading to tangible cost savings.</p>

									<hr class="major" id = "EdPlus"/>
									<h2>Business Data Analyst</h2>
									<h4>EdPlus at Arizona State University</h4>
									<div class="justify">
									<p>One of my key contributions was the creation and implementation of a dynamic scheduling model that effectively adapts to human behavior. This groundbreaking model significantly reduced the time required for schedule creation from 3 days to a mere 8 minutes, resulting in a remarkable decrease of over 99%. By optimizing resource allocation, this innovative approach revolutionized the scheduling process and streamlined operations. The efficient utilization of time and resources greatly enhanced productivity and overall performance.</p>
									<p>Another significant achievement was the design and development of an interactive Tableau dashboard aimed at visualizing essential key performance indicators (KPIs) pertaining to student behavior. This cutting-edge dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of class schedules, enabling better analysis and identification of areas for optimization. By adopting a data-driven approach, we successfully improved student engagement and academic performance. The intuitive visualization of student behavior allowed for a more straightforward interpretation of data, leading to more informed decisions and an optimized schedule.</p>
