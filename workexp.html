									<h2>Associate Data Scientist</h2>
									<h4>Constella Intelligence</h4>
									<p>During my tenure, I made significant contributions to data analysis and optimization. Applying data analysis techniques like data normalization, outlier detection and removal, and feature engineering in Python, I enhanced the quality and accuracy of the data. This resulted in a remarkable 20% increase in the speed of elastic search for a massive 200 GB dataset. Additionally, I designed and developed a Machine Learning model that effectively predicted the maliciousness of email IDs based on internet presence. To provide clients with a user-friendly interface, I deployed an API using Flask, enabling them to proactively mitigate potential threats. Furthermore, I excelled in designing, developing, and optimizing robust ETL pipelines using Python and SQL. These pipelines seamlessly ingested, processed, and integrated diverse data types from multiple sources, including structured and unstructured data. My collaboration with cross-functional teams and data-driven solutions significantly contributed to performance improvement across the organization.</p>
									<p>Beyond my core responsibilities, I took on additional leadership roles within the Data Science department. During a merger, I assumed the position of department lead and took ownership of all ongoing projects. My unwavering dedication and proactive approach ensured the timely delivery of these projects. Through my efforts, I earned the trust of the company, leading to my involvement in the hiring process for expanding the Data Science team. Additionally, I initiated an end-to-end operational plan for performance improvement, focusing on data handling, project management, and implementation. This comprehensive plan resulted in an estimated time reduction of 15% for ongoing projects. Moreover, I developed a Neural Network model to predict email ID maliciousness, deploying it through a Flask-based API. To ensure its continuous maintenance and updates, I trained and mentored two interns, preparing them for the demands of the role.</p>
									<p>Innovative problem-solving and leveraging cutting-edge technologies were key aspects of my contributions. Utilizing AWS Comprehend, I successfully extracted personally identifiable information (PII) from unstructured data, bolstering data privacy and security measures. Furthermore, I built a custom topic detection model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM-RNN) to classify website categories based on HTML text. This model enabled efficient categorization and organization of web data for better insights and decision-making. Additionally, I spearheaded a project aimed at predicting the type of identity theft users might face based on leaked information. Guiding the team throughout the development and deployment stages, I ensured the successful implementation of this predictive solution. Overall, my multifaceted contributions in data science, data analysis, leadership, and technological innovation drove significant improvements and yielded valuable outcomes for the organization.</p>

									<h2>Data Analyst</h2>
									<h4>EdPlus at Arizona State University</h4>
									<p>One of my key contributions was the creation and implementation of a dynamic scheduling model that effectively adapts to human behavior. This groundbreaking model significantly reduced the time required for schedule creation from 3 days to a mere 8 minutes, resulting in a remarkable decrease of over 99%. By optimizing resource allocation, this innovative approach revolutionized the scheduling process and streamlined operations. The efficient utilization of time and resources greatly enhanced productivity and overall performance.</p>
									<p>Another significant achievement was the design and development of an interactive Tableau dashboard aimed at visualizing essential key performance indicators (KPIs) pertaining to student behavior. This cutting-edge dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of class schedules, enabling better analysis and identification of areas for optimization. By adopting a data-driven approach, we successfully improved student engagement and academic performance. The intuitive visualization of student behavior allowed for a more straightforward interpretation of data, leading to more informed decisions and an optimized schedule.</p>
